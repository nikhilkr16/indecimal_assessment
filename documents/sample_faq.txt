## Project Management

### What factors affect construction project delays?

Construction project delays can be caused by several factors:

1. **Weather Conditions**: Rain, snow, extreme temperatures, and high winds can halt construction activities and damage materials.

2. **Material Shortages**: Delays in material delivery, supply chain disruptions, or unavailability of specific materials can impact timelines.

3. **Labor Issues**: Shortage of skilled workers, labor strikes, high turnover rates, or scheduling conflicts.

4. **Design Changes**: Mid-project design modifications require rework and additional time.

5. **Permit Delays**: Waiting for regulatory approvals, inspections, or permit renewals.

6. **Equipment Failures**: Breakdown of machinery, unavailability of specialized equipment, or maintenance issues.

7. **Poor Planning**: Inadequate project planning, unrealistic schedules, or poor coordination between teams.

8. **Financial Constraints**: Budget overruns, payment delays, or funding issues.
